# Hikvision Intercom

<p align="center"><img src="custom_components/hikvision_intercom/brand/icon@2x.png" width="180" alt="Hikvision Intercom" /></p>

One Home Assistant integration for a Hikvision / Hik-Connect video intercom, plus one
small app for the part that needs Hikvision's SDK:

| What | How |
|---|---|
| Door unlock, answer / hang up, volumes, do-not-disturb, call status, ring event | Hik-Connect cloud (no phone app needed) |
| Live camera | Directly from the station over your LAN |
| Custom doorbell chime on the indoor screen | Local SDK connection, through the **Hikvision SDK Bridge** app |

It replaces three integrations (`hikconnect`, `hikconnect_intercom`,
`hikvision_intercom_chime`), the *Hikvision Doorbell* app and the MQTT broker that
only they needed. Windows, iVMS, SADP and the Hik-Connect phone app are not required.

**HACS custom repository** (not submitted to the default catalogue).
[Türkçe kurulum rehberi](docs/KURULUM_TR.md).

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2026.10.0 or later.
- A Hik-Connect account that owns the station.
- For the chime only: Home Assistant OS or Supervised (it needs apps), and the station's
  private IPv4 address, SDK port (normally 8000) and **device admin** password (not the
  Hik-Connect password).

## Install

1. HACS -> three-dot menu -> Custom repositories -> add
   `https://github.com/bora-yarkin/hikvision-intercom-chime`, category **Integration**
   -> download **Hikvision Intercom** -> restart Home Assistant.
2. Settings -> Apps -> App store -> three-dot menu -> Repositories -> add the same URL ->
   install **Hikvision SDK Bridge** (the image is built on your device; the first build
   downloads about 26 MB). It may stay stopped; the integration starts it. The integration
   does not work without this app, and setup stops at an install prompt until it is there.
3. Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration -> **Hikvision Intercom**. One flow
   asks for the app (if missing), your Hik-Connect login, then the indoor station's address,
   SDK port and admin credentials, and finally confirms the app restart. The station
   password is stored only in the app's own options; the integration entry never contains it.

## Entities

Per Hik-Connect station: answer / hang up / unlock buttons, lock, camera, call status,
last ring, doorbell event, ringtone / two-way / microphone volumes, do-not-disturb and
status sensors. The chime joins the same device (one **Doorbell** device) when the account
has one device and one station; with more, each station gets its own device. Chime entities:

- **Play chime** - send the selected sound with the selected gain and repetitions.
- **Stop chime** - stop only this integration's own playback.
- **Digital gain** (-30..+30 dB) and **Repetitions** (1..10, at most 60 s in total).
  Changing either is silent and applies to the next press.
- **Request status** - idle / sending / error. *Sending* means the request was accepted,
  not that sound was heard.

Removing a local station deletes its uploaded sounds and removes its credentials from the
app's options (this restarts the app). Playback is refused while the station is ringing
or in a call. Nothing is ever played on
setup, reload, upload, or when a setting changes.

Default sound: a two-second ding-dong, four repetitions, 0 dB. Your own sound: station ->
configure icon on the station entry -> **Reconfigure** -> upload a WAV, 8000 Hz, mono,
16-bit PCM, at most 1 MiB / 30 s (other formats are rejected, not guessed at). Uploads
are kept privately under `.storage/hikvision_intercom/`; at most 16 per station.

## Door calls: talk and listen (best effort, unverified on a real call)

With a call answered, you can speak to the visitor and hear the door from Home Assistant.

- **Talk from a dashboard**: the call status sensor publishes `talk_path` (a WebSocket, 16 kHz 16-bit mono PCM in binary
  messages, opened on a path signed with `auth/sign_path`) and `listen_path`, so a dashboard that reads them (the Home Control
  dashboard's door-call popup does) can answer, talk and listen without knowing this integration. Any signed-in user may use them;
  one person talks at a time. A browser gives a page no microphone on plain `http` (other than localhost), so there the dashboard
  falls back to the phone app's Assist, below; on `https` the microphone works in the page.
- **Talk with Assist**: the app's own **Assist** records your voice natively (so this works on `http://homeassistant.local` too, where a
  web page cannot use the microphone). Create a voice assistant (Settings -> Voice assistants) with *Speech-to-text* = the
  **Call microphone** entity of the doorbell, *Conversation agent* = **Call acknowledge**, *Text-to-speech* = none. Open
  Assist in the app, pick it and speak; Assist ends a message at the first long pause, so tap again for the next one. If the
  call is still ringing when you speak, it is answered first. The speech goes through the SDK bridge app into the call.
- **Listen**: the door's audio during a call is a live WAV stream at
  `/api/hikvision_intercom/listen/<entry id>/<station id>` (any signed-in user, played from a signed address). The Home
  Control dashboard plays it from the door-call popup (it reads the sensor's `listen_path`).
- The app only opens the voice channel while the station reports a call in progress, and closes it when the call ends.

What is *not* verified: the written flow follows the Hikvision SDK and the community Hikvision Doorbell app (audio sent after
the call is answered goes to the door; audio the SDK receives is the door's, assumed G.711 mu-law). It needs one real call to
confirm both directions on a DS-KH6320.

## Moving from the old setup

Entity IDs derive from the device name, so the chime entities are named after the Doorbell
device (for example `button.doorbell_play_chime`); entities already registered by an earlier
version keep their IDs and move into the Doorbell device. Cloud entities lose the `_2`
suffix once the old integrations are removed.

Order: take a Home Assistant backup -> remove the three old integrations and the
*Hikvision Doorbell* app -> restart -> install the bridge app -> add the integration (one
flow: app check, login, station). Not carried over from the *Hikvision Doorbell* app: the ISAPI text box,
reboot, mute/unmute, two-way call on/off and the MQTT call-state sensors (call state and
volumes come from the cloud entities and the station's own call status instead).

## Status of this work

- 245 automated tests (integration in a real Home Assistant core 2026.10.4 harness, bridge
  app with a scripted SDK and a loopback HTTP server).
- The bridge image was built for arm64, loaded Hikvision's real SDK library, logged in to
  a DS-KH6320-WTE1 (V2.2.108) and read its call state (`idle`) read-only.
- **Not yet verified:** audible playback through the new bridge, and a clean install of
  the app through Home Assistant's app store on a live system.
