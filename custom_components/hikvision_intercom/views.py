"""The door's audio during a call, for a dashboard: a live WAV stream to listen to and a WebSocket to talk into.

Both are authenticated like every Home Assistant API view; neither a browser audio element nor a browser WebSocket can send a
header, so the dashboard asks Home Assistant for a short-lived signed path (``auth/sign_path``) and uses that. Any signed-in user
may use them: the household answers the door, and the dashboard's own access rules decide who is shown the controls. The two paths are published on the call status sensor as ``listen_path`` and ``talk_path``, which is how a dashboard
that knows no brand finds them.
